Question:

Adding Custom Fonts iOS 4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:

This tutorial will show you how to add your own custom fonts into an app for devices using iOS 4 and above.
While working on a new app I was wondering how if there was anyway I could use the same font I had used for my logo and buttons within UITextViews and wherever else I wanted to a 
display custom text
  1) Add the .TTF or .OTF font file/s you wish to use as a resource
  2) Open your info.plist and create a new key called UIAppFonts, set the key to be an array type.
  3) For each font you want to use in your app, add it as a new object in the array with its full name and extension and save the info.plist when finished
  4) Now in your code you can simply call
         1.1 Default UIFont Example [UIFont fontWithName:@"Insert font name here" size:18]
     to get the custom font to use with your UILabels and UITextView. Or if using Cocos2d you can call
         1.2 Cocos2d Label Example CCLabelTTF *header = [CCLabelTTF labelWithString:@"Hello World" fontName:@"Insert font name here" fontSize:22];
